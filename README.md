New Learnings apart from the concepts that I have learnt before are:
1, First I have made a mistake on "onclick" field of the button where we have to put the function name that we will be creating in javascript later on.
2, first i have learnt about three variants of taking input to the an variable through the document ->
  i, let var = document.querySelector([.class_name]/[#id_name]);
  ii, let var = document.getElementById("id_name");
  iii, let var = document.getElementByClassName("class_name");
3, learnt better way of aligning element by using a mixture of div elements, flex displays.
